  - AutoComplete_Inter.java -> interface provided by instructor
  - Dict.java -> interface provided by instructor
  - dictionary.txt -> english dictionary 
  - DLB.java -> written by me (a DLB to implement Dict.java)
  - DLBNode.java -> dlb node provided by instructor (node used in DLB.java)
  - HistNode.java -> written by me (node used in UserHistory.java)
  - MyStringBuilder.java, MyStringBuilder2.java -> written by me (was not allowed to use stringbulder from java library)
  - seeStructure.java -> written by me, interactive test program (allows user to dynamically test the auto-completer)
