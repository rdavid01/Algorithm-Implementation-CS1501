  - DLBNode.java -> dlb node provided by instructor (node used in DLB.java)
  - HistNode.java -> written by me (node used in UserHistory.java)
  - MyStringBuilder.java, MyStringBuilder2.java -> written by me (was not allowed to use stringbulder from java library)
  - seeStructure.java -> written by me, interactive test program (allows user to dynamically test the auto-completer)

4.**Project 4: Graphs and Networks**
  - AdjacencyList.java -> adjacency list for implementation
  - AdjNode.java -> node for adjacency list
  - App.java -> start the tests
  - ArticulationPointSearch.java -> search for articulation point
  - DFS.java -> used to check if graph is connected if only consider copper based connections

  - IndirectionNode.java -> node for indirection table
  - MyDijkstra.java -> used to find lowest average latency path
  - MyPrim.java -> used to find lowest average latency spanning tree
  - NetAnalysis.java -> functions for analyzing graphs and networks (implements NetAnalysis_Inter.java)
  - NetAnalysis_Inter.java -> interface provided by instructor
  - STE.java -> provided by instructor, spanning tree edge
  - network_data2.txt -> data used for the test

5.**Project 5: BigInteger Implementation**
  - HeftyInteger.java -> implement a data type that can perform operations on arbitrarily large integers (similar to BigInteger)
